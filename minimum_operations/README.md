# **Minimum Operations** :computer:

## **Description** :speech_balloon:

*Minimum Operations is a computational concept that involves determining the least number of actions required to achieve a specific objective in a computer algorithm or process. This concept is particularly significant in optimization and efficiency enhancement, where the goal is to achieve the desired outcome with the least amount of resource expenditure, whether those resources are time, memory, or computational power. In practical terms, Minimum Operations can apply to a variety of scenarios, from simple tasks like character manipulation in a text file to more complex operations in data processing and algorithm design. Understanding and implementing Minimum Operations is crucial in developing effective and efficient software solutions, as it directly impacts the performance and scalability of applications and systems.

## **Tasks** :books:

#### **0. Minimum Operations**

In a text file, there is a single character H. Your text editor can execute only two operations in this file: Copy All and Paste. Given a number n, write a method that calculates the fewest number of operations needed to result in exactly n H characters in the file. Be smart about how you utilize the memory!

    Prototype: def minOperations(n)
    Returns an integer
    If n is impossible to achieve, return 0

Example:

n = 9

H => Copy All => Paste => HH => Paste =>HHH => Copy All => Paste => HHHHHH => Paste => HHHHHHHHH

Number of operations: 6
