# **Heap Insert** :computer:

## **Description**

* Heap Insert is a crucial operation in the realm of data structures, particularly in the management of heaps, which are specialized tree-based structures. Heaps are commonly used to implement priority queues, where elements are processed based on their priority rather than in a strict sequential order. The Heap Insert operation involves adding a new element to the heap while maintaining its characteristic property - either a max-heap, where the parent node is always larger than its children, or a min-heap, where the parent node is always smaller. This operation starts by adding the new element to the end of the heap (the bottom-most, right-most position in the tree) and then 'bubbling' it up to its correct position in the heap by comparing it with its parent node and swapping if necessary. This ensures that the heap's structural and order properties are maintained, allowing for efficient retrieval of the highest or lowest priority element. The Heap Insert operation is fundamental in various applications, including sorting algorithms, graph algorithms, and maintaining dynamically changing datasets.
